Parallel computing tasks using hadoop

Mapreduce is a method designed for parallel compution. Mapreduce is helpful for computation in large graphs. For example, social network. The following codes are two examples I created for graph analysis using mapreduce. 
1. Use mapreduce for Breadth first search in Social network, find the shortes path between individuals. 

2. Use map reduce for Pagerank calculation in Social network.
